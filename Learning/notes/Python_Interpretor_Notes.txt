The interpreter in python can be used to perform functions like math
as In console.
Example -
2019- 1991
28
2*32
64
2**23
8388608
2**32-1
4294967295

Dynamic typing - Means data types and variables are defined at runtime
example =
x=2 no need to right int
x = 2.1 (No need to write float)
x = 'Two' (No need to write String)  (Comparing the dynamic typing to java)



-> A NONE in python is Null

Arrays are diff in python , they are called as lists.
List type is hybrid .

Covered how a list is worked in python , dynamics of it - Path - Arrays-Lists/Lists_1/Lists_1.py


NOTE - Python treat all the data types That can be indexed.
strings Example
s = 'π = 3.14' --------- value of PI is getting stored in a string object called S.
len(s) is going to tell me the lenght of the String
example from console -
s = 'pi= 3.14'
len(s)
8

example -
digits = '0123456789'
digits[3]
'3'
len(digits)
10

NOTE - “Sequence data types can be concatenated, multiplied, searched, and enumerated.”

Examples

[1,2,3] + ['a','b']
[1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b']

'123' *7
'123123123123123123123'

3 in [1,2,3]
True

“elm' in ['Elm', 'Asp', 'Oak']”

'elm' in ['Elm', 'Asp', 'Oak']
False
'Elm' in ['Elm', 'Asp', 'Oak']
True

“The range() and enumerate() functions actually create iterators, which are complex data types that get called in each loop iteration to get the next value of the sequence.”

------------
Importing stuff in pyhton is important , as in you dont need dependnency injection to make stuff work or constructor


Talking about try catch statments in python


“try:
    long_running_function()
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print('Keyboard interrupted long running function')
except IndexError:
    print('Index out of range during long running function')”
